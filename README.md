# fina_project
This is a final project created for GEOG 458

I have created a map that plots the records of police violences from **2013 to 2019**

This is an interactive map that allows users to choose the categories they want to view. I have included three choices, police violence based on age, ethnicity and gender.


Used libraries
- carto.js
- leaflet.js
- D3.js
